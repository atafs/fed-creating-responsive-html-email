Build an HTML responsive email using the mockup and images attached

### Design and Pattern choices:
- I have chosen the Responsive Design with Tables, in order to render acceptably over more than 30 of the most popular web-based email clients.

### Setting Expectations:
- Responsive Email design may negatively affect the layout for older, web-based email clients.
- Single column emails will render properly in most number of them.
- Simply flowing the elements to the right or left.
- In order to scale to more complex emails layouts, that gracefull degrade in older email clients, this choice allows to change the screen size in a responsive way (breaking down elements and customizing them to specific screen sizes).
